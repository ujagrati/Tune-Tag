## TuneTag

TuneTag is an advanced Python application designed for accurate song identification using audio fingerprinting techniques and microphone input. Initially inspired by an open-source project, TuneTag has undergone extensive modifications to ensure compatibility with Python 3, streamlined code structures, and optimized performance. The application has been Dockerized for seamless deployment and scalability, specifically tailored for Linux environments.
Features
- Robust Song Identification: TuneTag employs sophisticated audio fingerprinting algorithms capable of accurately identifying up to 1000 distinct songs.
- Real-time Audio Processing: Utilizing microphone input, TuneTag swiftly analyzes audio snippets within 5 seconds, generating hash points for efficient song detection.

## Requirements

    Python 3.6 or higher
    Docker
    Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS recommended)

## Installation
Docker Installation

Ensure Docker is installed on your Linux system. Refer to the official Docker documentation for installation instructions suitable for your distribution.
Building and Running TuneTag

    git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git
    cd repository

  Build the Docker image:
  
    docker build -t tunetag .

  Run TuneTag within a Docker container:

    docker run -it --rm tunetag

### Usage
- Launch TuneTag: Start the application within the Docker container.

- Microphone Input: Ensure your microphone is connected and accessible.

- Song Identification: Play a song or audio snippet near the microphone. TuneTag will process the audio in real-time and display the identified song within moments.
